- Only create an abstraction if it's actually needed
- Prefer clear function/variable names over inline comments
- Avoid helper functions when a simple inline expression would suffice
- Use `knip` to remove unused code if making large changes
- The `gh` CLI is installed, use it
- Don't use emojis
- Use `pnpm` for package

## Project Structure

- Pages in `src/pages/`
- Reusable components in `src/components/`
- Hooks in `src/hooks/`
- Utilities in `src/lib/`
- Types in `src/types/` or colocated with usage

## React

- Avoid massive JSX blocks and compose smaller components
- Colocate code that changes together
- Avoid `useEffect` unless absolutely needed

## Tailwind

- Mostly use built-in values, occasionally allow dynamic values, rarely globals
- Always use v4 + global CSS file format + shadcn/ui

## TypeScript

- Don't unnecessarily add `try`/`catch`
